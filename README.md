# Plot-wave-functions-FDM-Schrodinger
I created a short MATLAB script to plot the lowest four eigenvalues (corresponding to the ground state, first excited state, second excited state and third excited state) and plots each associated wavefunction of the Schrodinger equation given some potential energy distribution.  The plot of each wavefunction is placed so that it is centred on its respective energy level (eigenvalue).  It also plots the potential energy of the system as a function of position. It plots the wavefunction onto the potential energy distribution so that we can see how the changing potential affects the probability of finding the particle at a certain position.
